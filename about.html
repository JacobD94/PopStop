        alt="a picture of the foudner, Jamie Ramirez, in a suit" class="jamieRamirezPic">PopStop started as a colorful dream in a garage filled with fizz, flavor, and friends. Back in 2018, our founder, Jamie “Fizz” Ramirez, began experimenting with homemade soda recipes using fresh fruit, spices, and a wild imagination. What began as a neighborhood hit—served out of an ice chest at local events—quickly bubbled into a full-fledged passion. With a knack for unique flavors and a love for all things retro, Jamie transformed that fizz-fueled hobby into PopStop: an online soda shop where creativity and refreshment go hand in hand.</p>
